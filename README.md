### Sorting Algorithms (`sorting.py`)

Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a particular order, typically ascending or descending.

- **Bubble Sort**: 
  - A simple comparison-based sort where adjacent elements are swapped until the list is sorted.
  - Usage: `bubble_sort(arr)`

- **Merge Sort**: 
  - A divide-and-conquer algorithm that breaks the list into halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
  - Usage: `merge_sort(arr)`

### Searching Algorithms (`searching.py`)

Searching algorithms aim to find the position of a target element in a list or determine its absence.

- **Linear Search**:
  - A basic searching algorithm that scans every element of the list.
  - Usage: `linear_search(arr, x)`

- **Binary Search**:
  - A fast search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted list.
  - Usage: `binary_search(arr, x)`

### Dynamic Programming (`dynamic_programming.py`)

Dynamic programming is a method to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. It avoids redundant calculations by storing the results of expensive function calls.

- **Knapsack Problem**:
  - Determines the maximum value attainable with a given weight capacity and items of different values and weights.
  - Usage: `knapsack(values, weights, capacity)`

*(... other dynamic programming problems can be listed similarly ...)*

### Backtracking (`backtracking.py`)

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems by trying out a sequence of choices and undoing them if they don't lead to a solution.

- **Sudoku Solver**:
  - Tries to fill a Sudoku grid using backtracking.
  - Usage: `solve_sudoku(board)`

*(... other backtracking problems can be listed similarly ...)*
